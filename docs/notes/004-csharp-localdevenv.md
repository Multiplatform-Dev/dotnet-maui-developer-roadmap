# [Setup Your Local Dev Environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/tutorials/local-environment)

## Summary
So far we've worked with the browser-based runtime for learning. But it has limitations in features and customizability. Plus, having a local developer environment that fits into your app development workflow (including CI/CD) is ideal. In this section, we'll try out
 * .NET CLI (with [.NET install](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/intro))
 * .NET CLI with Visual Studio Code
 * [Console app in Visual Studio 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/get-started/csharp/tutorial-console?view=vs-2019)


Commands we learn for workflow:
 * `dotnet new`  = scaffold new project
 * `dotnet build` = build executable 
 * `dotnet run` = run exectuable
